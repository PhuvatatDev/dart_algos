# 🧠 Dart Algorithms by PVTDev

A personal collection of algorithm exercises written in Dart to practice logic, problem-solving, and clean code.

This repository is part of my journey to become a proficient Flutter & full-stack mobile developer.  
Each exercise is saved in a separate file with clean code, comments, and tested outputs.


Each file includes:
- A clear exercise title
- Well-commented Dart code
- A `main()` function to test the logic

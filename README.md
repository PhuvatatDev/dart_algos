# 🧠 Dart Algorithms by PVTDev

A personal collection of algorithm exercises written in Dart to practice logic, problem-solving, and clean code.

This repository is part of my journey to become a proficient Flutter & full-stack mobile developer.
Each exercise is saved in a separate file with clean code, comments, and tested outputs.

📄 File: `exos_08_anagram_checker.dart`

---

### 🔹 09 - Group Words by Length

**Description:** Groups a list of strings by word length into a `Map<int, List<String>>`.
📄 File: `exos_09_group_by_length.dart`

## ✅ Goals

* Practice clean and readable Dart code.
* Build confidence in solving logic-based challenges.
* Prepare for technical interviews and app feature logic.

## ▶️ How to run the algorithms

To run any exercise, make sure you have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed.
Then open your terminal at the root of this project and run:

```bash
dart exos/exos_01_most_frequent_element.dart
```
